- Hey there, the name's @nix24, you call call me Jaylon
- I’m interested in learning more about software development as whole. My projects are a mix of class projects and personal projects.
I mainly focus in javascript applications, with nextjs or sveltekit. Currently learning usage with APIS, learning how to utliza data with databases. but most projects here are small personal projects that interested me when I'm not doing college work. Feel free to look around. Hopefully these fun projects can evolve more in scale as I get better as a developer!
